# Biography

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics. My research interests are focused on machine learning, epigenetics, proteomics and computer-aided drug design.

I studied and completed my master at Ege University Department of Biostatistics in 2011 and I have developed new approaches for assessment of bioequivalence studies using nonlinear mixed-effects models.

I worked as a visiting scientist at RCSB Protein Data Bank (at University of California, San Diego) and have developed new approaches for the evaluation of biological assemblies and protein-protein interfaces. I completed my PhD under supervision of Prof. Dr. Osman Saraçbaşı and Dr. Peter W. Rose in 2016 at Hacettepe University Department of Biostatistics.
